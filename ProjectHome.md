This is a beta version.

---

The project provides a series of classes to manage Google Drive API.
Please, see https://developers.google.com/drive/v2/reference/ to understand how Drive works.

The API is written to be used inside an Adobe AIR project.

The documentation provided is still to complete. Anyway the structure of the API is build mirroring (more or less) the Google Drive API reference, so for any question regarding the Drive API you can refer to the Google site linked above.

In the wiki section, there is an example to understand how the client works.

Please, report any found issues.

N.B.;
The framework uses these three libraries:

as3commons-logging-2.7.swc
as3corelib.swc
as3crypto.swc


It uses also the OAuth 2 library provided by:
